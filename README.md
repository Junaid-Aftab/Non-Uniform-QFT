# Non-Uniform Quantum Fourier Transform (NUQFT)

## Overview

The Non-Uniform Quantum Fourier Transform (NUQFT) extends the standard Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to settings where sampling points are not uniformly space. Many practical signal processing, imaging, and numerical simulation problems involve irregular sampling grids, making classical and quantum Fourier methods designed for uniform grids insufficient.

This repository contains a numerical and algorithmic implementation of the our NUQFT algorithm, including:

- Classical reference implementations of the Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform (NUDFT)
- Low-rank factorization routines used to construct efficient NUQFT circuits
- Quantum-oriented components that simulate the unitary primitives required by the algorithm
- Experiments validating theoretical predictions such as low-rank structure and precision scaling

### Problem Statement

The classical **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** assumes signals are sampled at **uniform locations**. However, real-world data often arises from **non-uniform sampling**, due to:

- irregular measurement grids  
- adaptive numerical methods  
- physical constraints in sensing systems  

To address this, the **Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform (NUDFT)** computes Fourier coefficients from non-uniform spatial samples.

Mathematically, given samples

\[
x_j = f(t_j)
\]

taken at non-uniform points \(t_j\), the NUDFT computes

\[
X_k = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j e^{-i \omega_k t_j}
\]

where the frequencies \(\omega_k\) may also be non-uniform. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

While efficient classical algorithms exist for this transform, a **fully quantum analogue had not been systematically developed**. This project implements and evaluates a quantum algorithm that approximates the NUDFT using **low-rank structure and block-encoding techniques**.

# Methodology

The NUQFT algorithm is based on three key ideas.

## 1. Low-Rank Factorization of the NUDFT

The NUDFT matrix can be approximated by a **low-rank decomposition**

\[
F_{II} \approx \sum_{r=0}^{K-1} D_{u_r} \, F \, D_{v_r}
\]

where:

- \(F\) is the standard DFT matrix
- \(D_{u_r}\) and \(D_{v_r}\) are diagonal matrices derived from Chebyshev expansions. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

This decomposition converts the non-uniform Fourier transform into a **sum of structured operations involving standard Fourier transforms**.

---

## 2. Quantum Block-Encoding

Each matrix term in the decomposition is embedded inside a **unitary operator** using block encoding. This enables quantum circuits to simulate matrix multiplication while preserving reversibility.

Block encoding is a central technique used in modern quantum linear algebra algorithms. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## 3. Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU)

The sum

\[
\sum_r D_{u_r} F D_{v_r}
\]

is implemented using the **Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU)** framework, which constructs a quantum circuit representing weighted sums of unitary operators.

---

## Resulting Complexity

The resulting NUQFT circuit achieves:

- **Polylogarithmic scaling with precision**
- **Quadratic dependence on number of qubits**
- **Logarithmic dependence on geometry parameters**

These properties arise from the efficient low-rank structure and block-encoding formulation. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

# Sample Results

The experiments in this repository replicate several theoretical results from the paper.

## Low-Rank Scaling

The NUDFT kernel admits a **rapidly convergent low-rank approximation**, meaning only a small number of terms \(K\) are needed to approximate the transform with high precision.

Observed behavior:

\[
K = O\left(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\log\log(1/\epsilon)}\right)
\]

Numerical experiments confirm this theoretical prediction.

## Project Description
The NUQFT generalizes the standard Quantum Fourier Transform by relaxing the assumption of uniformly spaced inputs in signal or frequency domains. This repository focuses on the numerical implementation and evaluation of the proposed NUQFT algorithm, including simulations, validation experiments, and performance analysis.
